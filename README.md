# Pset

Pset stands for program set. We build applications on top of many excellent programs, compiler/interpreter, regex engine, web server, just to name a few. Usually, for daily working purposes, We don't need to build full-fledged versions of them. However, it's worthwhile to dip your toe in the water. In this repo, I collect simple versions of these programs,
typically backed by great tutorials that are more than enough for self-teaching purpose. To be honest, I don't design the programs, I only collect. All credits should be given to the original authors.

Getting myself familiar with this Pset will do a great help to my skills, and more importantly, my understanding of what's going on underlying all abstractions. [Leaky abstraction](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) happens all the time, we've got to know more and get prepared. Another thought I have in mind is that, when I want to get some hands-on practices with a new programming language, re-implementing them may be a good choice.

Here is the list:

| Program                              | Go  | Python |
|--------------------------------------|-----|--------|
| [Interpreter](./interpreter)         | ✅   | -      |
| [Web Server](./web-server)           | ✅   | ✅      |
| [Web Framework](./web-framework)     | ✅   | -      |
| [MapReduce](./map-reduce)            | ✅   | -      |
| [Circuit Breaker](./circuit-breaker) | -   | -      |
