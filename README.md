# Pset

Pset stands for program set. We build applications on top of many excellent programs, compiler/interpreter, regex engine, web server, just to name a few. Usually, for daily working purposes, We don't need to build a full-fledged version of them. However, it's worthwhile to get a taste. In this repo, I collect simple versions of these programs,
typically backed by great tutorials that are more than enough for self-teaching purpose. To be honest, I don't design the programs, I only collect. All credits should be given to the original authors.

Getting myself familiar with this Pset will do a great help to my skills and more importantly, my understanding of what's going on in the lower abstraction. [Leaky abstraction](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) happens all the time. Another thought I have in mind is that, when I want to get some hands-on practices with a new programming language, maybe implementing them is a good choice.
